## Common Keyboard shortcuts

* `CMD` + `P` Brings up a prompt where you can type in the name of a file, hit enter, and have the file opened.
* `CMD` + `Shift` + `P` Brings up Command Palette. I frequently use "Change Language Mode".
* `Opt` + `↑ or ↓` Move selected text block. 
* `CTRL` + `CMD` + `G` Select all occurrences of highlighted string
* `CMD` + `D` Select next occurrence of highlighted string

You can open the current directory from the command line by typing ```code .```. Note [You have to do a small bit of setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).
