On every new project I try to change one or two tools and/or techniques. This is a good balance, because if I change too many things, I get bogged down in the details and functionality of new tools. But if I change nothing, I never get the chance to learn new tools, and increase my productivity.

For my personal blog (you're reading it), I'm switching my text-editor from Sublime Text to Visual Studio Code.

## Why the switch?


## My background
on Mac
Dreamweaver
Sublime
PHPStorm

## Common Keyboard shortcuts

Avoiding using your mouse or trackpad is vital to coding quickly. To that end, here are some keyboard shortcuts that I use often.

* `CMD` + `P` Brings up a prompt where you can type in the name of a file, hit enter, and have the file opened.
* `CMD` + `Shift` + `P` Brings up Command Palette. I frequently use "Change Language Mode".
* `Opt` + `↑ or ↓` Move selected text block. 
* `CTRL` + `CMD` + `G` Select all occurrences of highlighted string
* `CMD` + `D` Select next occurrence of highlighted string

## Tips

## How is the speed?

### Open the current directory in VSCode from the terminal

You can open the current directory from the command line by typing 
```bash
$ code .
```
Note [You have to do a small bit of setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) to get this to work.
