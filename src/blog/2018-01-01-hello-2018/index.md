I'm looking forward to 2018 with excitement and a bit of trepidation. 

## Technical Goals
* Continue learning ReactJS.
* Learn CSS Grid -- I'm already doing this.
* Speak at a non-Drupal front-end conference. It's harder to get sessions accepted than you'd think.
* Work on a Drupal 8 and/or decoupled JavaScript project at Lullabot.

## Parenting Goals
* Continue keepin' on. Millie is awesome. 
* Encourage her to read. She's doing this now, but being a bookworm is awesome.
* Get her more comfortable with trying new foods and experiences. This has always been a challenge.

## Personal Goals
* Health (losing weight - need to get firmer on this).
* Continue traveling. I plan on going to Europe again this year (either Amsterdam or Zurich).
* Financial - Build up a decent emergency fund. Move my old FHSAA 403b into something better.
* Continue maintaining awesome friendships.
