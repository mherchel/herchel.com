Last month, I had the opportunity to go to Utrecht, in the Netherlands for [Frontend United](https://www.frontendunited.org). Frontend United was an amazingly well run conference, and had some amazing content from speakers like [Harry Roberts](https://www.frontendunited.org/sessions/facsst-css-and-performance), [Dries Buytaert](https://www.frontendunited.org/sessions/exploring-new-drupal-front-end-javascript), and [Heydon Pickering](https://www.frontendunited.org/sessions/get-your-priorities-straight).

I presented on [Debugging, Profiling, & Rocking Out with Browser-Based Developer Tools](https://www.frontendunited.org/sessions/debugging-profiling-rocking-out-browser-based-developer-tools), which is a tried and true session that I've given tens of times. It went over pretty well. 

Enjoy!
