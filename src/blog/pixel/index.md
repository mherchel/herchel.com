too large
screen is nice
google assistant is way better than siri
love the fingerprint sensor on back
i like the little square button that allows you to switch applications
i hate that the brightness is not easily accessible from the pull down
amazing camera
got 175 for iphone 6
list of apps
love the USBC
Battery seems to last a long time
charges quick
lack of airdrop
