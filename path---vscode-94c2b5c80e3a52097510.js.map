I liked the built in intellisense (autocomplete, quick info, list parameters, etc) that was offered in PHPStorm, but not in Sublime.</p>\\n<h3>What I didn’t like about Sublime</h3>\\n<p>Sublime is fast, but it’s bare-bones. In order to get to a nice configuration, you need to install and configure many plugins such as <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Package%20Control\\\">Package Control</a>, <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet\\\">Emmet</a>, <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements\\\">Sidebar Enhancements</a>, <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter\\\">Sublime Linter</a>, <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BracketHighlighter\\\">Bracket Highlighter</a>, etc.</p>\\n<p>Sublime requires a lot of configuration, it has questionable code highlighting, and linting integration not super tight (even with Sublime Linter).</p>\\n<h3>What I didn’t like about PHPStorm</h3>\\n<p>PHPStorm seemed slow. It’s slow to open — and although it’s very feature packed, it’s frequently hard to find what you’re looking to do.</p>\\n<h2>About VSCode</h2>\\n<p>Visual Studio Code is weird. It’s created by Microsoft, which gives it away for free. In addition to Windows, they also support OSX and Linux. Weird. </p>\\n<p>It’s built on top of <a href=\\\"https://electronjs.org/\\\">Electron</a>, which allows for the development of desktop apps using Chromium and Node, which are web development framework / runtimes.</p>\\n<p>VSCode occupies the sweet spot between IDE and text editor. It’s fairly quick to launch — although not as quick as Sublime Text. But, that’s not a huge deal. I have my editor open all day, as opposed to continually closing and relaunching. While the editor is open, it seems just as fast 😎.</p>\\n<h2>VSCode Features</h2>\\n<p>VSCode comes with many features standard and enabled out of the box!</p>\\n<h3>Intellisense / Autocomplete</h3>\\n<p>This is enabled out of the box.

It’s easier than Sublime’s plugin handling, which is all text command based.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The plugin management interface is easy to find. The plugin dashboard has its own icon to the left of the directory tree.</li>\\n<li>It will recommend plugins to you based on the types of files that you open. If I open lots of markdown files, it will recommend a popular markdown plugin. If I open lots of JavaScript files, it will show me plugins for that.</li>\\n<li>It allows you to install plugins through the GUI. Normally, I like to use keyboard shortcuts for everything. But, installing plugins is not a normal day-to-day activity. Browsing, choosing, installing, and configuring plugins is easier through a graphical interface.</li>\\n<li>It shows your currently installed plugins, and allows you to disable/uninstall them easily. This makes it easy to test-drive and compare plugins.</li>\\n<li>You can easily search for new plugins using the GUI, or just show the most popular plugins for you to explore.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-62b88.png\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 64.38467807660962%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"VSCode's plugin interface\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-42603.png\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-f931c.png 200w,\\n/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-e8031.png 400w,\\n/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-42603.png 800w,\\n/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-5b8b9.png 1200w,\\n/static/plugin-interface-annotated-d0a4ecb64c434d81f17bacec335ba2e2-62b88.png 1227w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<h3>Here’s what I currently have installed</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/HookyQR/VSCodeBeautify\\\">Beautify</a> reformats and reindents your JavaScript, CSS, HTML and more.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/mastazi/VS-code-drupal\\\">Drupal Syntax Highlighting</a> does exactly what you think it does :)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint\\\">ESLint</a> provides integration with the popular ESLint JavaScript linting engine.
